## Punctuation usage when mixing Chinese and English

English sometimes appears in Chinese technical documents. At this time, not only Chinese punctuation in full-width form, but also English punctuation in half-width form may be used. Therefore, when mixing Chinese and English, attention should be paid to the usage of punctuation marks.

This section describes the recommended norms for the use of punctuation at the interface between Chinese and English.

### Fundamental Principles

Chinese technical documents mainly serve Chinese text, which should be based on Chinese punctuation and supplemented by English punctuation.

### Basic Specifications

1. When using English words or phrases in Chinese sentences:

    - The English words or phrases used in the clips may not be enclosed in Chinese quotation marks.
    - **If the English word or phrase used in the clip contains English punctuation, keep its English punctuation**.
    - Chinese sentences should end with Chinese punctuation marks.

2. When using English sentences within Chinese sentences:

    - Quote the English sentence in Chinese quotation marks.
    - **If the English sentence used in the clip contains English punctuation, keep its English punctuation**.
    - Chinese sentences should end with Chinese punctuation marks.

Based on the basic specification above, the following table gives examples of different punctuation usages:

| Punctuation | 【When using English words or phrases in Chinese sentences】Examples of punctuation usage | 【When using English sentences in Chinese sentences】Examples of punctuation usage |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | --------- --------------- |
| period | - change and transform have different meanings. <br />- It is recommended to call Jane. | - "I like you." is different from "I love you.". <br />- He said "Jane, you can do it.". |
| Comma | The official description for this database is "open-source, distributed SQL database". | Their official documentation says "Try it out, and you will get a 10% discount.". |
| Question mark | What does distributed SQL mean here? | He stretched out his hand and said "Need a hand?" which means "Do you need help?"? |
| Exclamation mark | Don't always say "Pretty!" to girls! | He stood there and exclaimed "What a beautiful scene!". |
| comma | be verbs include is, are, were, was, etc. | What is the difference between "He is man.", "He is a man." and "He is the man"? |
| Semicolon | If you want a more polite tone, use might; otherwise, use may. | The official document says "To deploy the database, use the TiUP tool; to migrate data, use the DM tool.". |
| Colon | - The official website has a home button that does not work: Newsletter. <br />- TiDB: The Future of Databases is a topic sharing blog. | - The top right corner of the documentation station reads: Try it now. <br />- Bilibili: How We Use a Distributed SQL Database is a case study. |
| Quotes | The future tense generally consists of "will + the original form of the verb". | There is a sentence in this article that is more difficult to understand: "The saint said, 'Follow your fear.'". |
| Dash | This symbol indicates prohibition -- stop. | "Well—emm, I don't know how to say—but I hope you can understand my position." he said wryly. |
| Ellipsis | Use the so...that... sentence pattern for results, meaning "so...that...". | "I don't know how to say this..." means "I don't know how to say this...". |
