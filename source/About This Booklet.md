# About this booklet

This guide standardizes a Chinese writing style, which is mainly used for the writing of technical documents. The material comes from the Internet. It is a synthesis of various Chinese copywriting style guides. It aims to provide reference specifications for Chinese technical documents in terms of language style, structure style, content elements, punctuation, format and layout.

It is hoped that the emergence of this guide will contribute to the establishment of industry standards in the future.

## Purpose

- Adjudication of disputed issues in the process of reviewing documents
- It can also be used as a reference for developers of software interfaces, help documents and other materials

> RFC (Request For Comments) refers to formal documents about Internet standards. In the process of expressing these documents, it is necessary to strictly distinguish which are "suggestions" and which are "requirements". Therefore, RFC2119 specifically stipulates the meaning of five keywords, which respectively indicate the strictness of "requirements".
