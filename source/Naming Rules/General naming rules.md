## name usage

When using some special names in Chinese technical documents, please pay attention to the following specifications.

### Specifications for the use of names of foreign companies, brands or products

When referring to foreign companies, brands or product names in Chinese documents, it is recommended to follow the following guidelines:

- For the company, brand or product name that **Chinese readers are familiar with its official Chinese translation name**, only need to use **Chinese official translation name** to refer to
- For companies, brands or product names that are unfamiliar to **Chinese readers but have an official Chinese translation**, it is recommended to use the form "**Chinese official translation (English official name)**"
- For the company, brand or product name without official Chinese translation, it is recommended to refer to it directly in **English**, and must use the **correct capitalization** form

    - [Error example] mysql, github, tiktok, wechat
    - [Correct example] MySQL, GitHub, TikTok, WeChat

Precautions:

- Judging whether a name is familiar to Chinese general readers is subjective. If you are not sure whether a Chinese reader is familiar with a name, it is recommended to give priority to the form of "official Chinese translation (official English name)".
- When using the form of "Chinese official translation (English official name)", you only need to use the full form when the name appears for the first time, and then use the Chinese official translation when it appears again.
