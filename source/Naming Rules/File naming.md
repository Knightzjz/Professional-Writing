## file naming

This section takes technical documents written in the Markdown language as an example to introduce the naming conventions of source files. As follows.

- The filename should give a brief summary of the document content.
- The file name should not be too long.
- When the file name consists of multiple English words, the words should be separated by a dash "-".
- Using underscore "_" in filenames is not recommended. Underscores in URLs are bad for SEO, and underscores are modifier characters in some Markdown implementations.
- When the file name consists of multiple English words, it is recommended to use all lowercase words for the file name, and all uppercase words are acceptable, such as FAQ.md.
- Do not mix upper and lower case for file names.
- The file extension should be in lowercase.
- Markdown files should use ".md" suffix, ".markdown" is acceptable, but the style must be consistent.
