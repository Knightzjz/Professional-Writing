## Product name

A company should follow certain style guidelines when naming its products (or peripheral tools), not arbitrary names. Otherwise, there will be legal risks (duplication of names) in severe cases, and external brand output will be affected in light cases.

It is recommended to establish a unified process for product naming and maintain a unified product name list throughout the company.
