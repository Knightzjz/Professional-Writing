## Concise and clear

Concise language should be used in technical documentation. **It is recommended that the author read the entire document after completing the first draft**, delete all words, words and sentences in the text that have no obvious effect on expressing the meaning, and reduce the length of the copy to the shortest without affecting the expressive effect. The specific requirements are:

- Prohibit verboseness
- No logical confusion
- Do not express the same thing repeatedly in the same document
- Try to use **active tense**, especially to **describe clearly the subject and object**
