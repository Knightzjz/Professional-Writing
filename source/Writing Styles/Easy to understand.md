## Easy to understand

Terms that are only understood by certain groups of people are not recommended in technical documentation. The specific requirements are:

- It is not recommended to use jargon, slang, swear words, etc., such as "magic change" (that is, special optimization), "CPU hit 60%" (that is, the CPU usage rate is 60%) and other jargon and slang
- Internet buzzwords are not recommended, such as intentional homophonic typos in buzzwords such as "wall cracks" and "children's shoes"

### Case

Case number one:

- [Error] "Welcome all TWs to add cases around you."
- [Correct] "All document workers are welcome to supplement the cases around you."
- [Explanation] TW means Tech Writer, which means (technical) document engineer. This is an acronym known only to practitioners in the field of technical writing, and is suggested to be revised in order to be understood by a wider audience.
