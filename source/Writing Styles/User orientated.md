## User orientated

Technical documentation should be user-oriented. In order to write a highly usable document, the author of the document should try to think from the user's point of view. The specific requirements are:

- The author of the document should fully consider the technical level distribution of the audience of the document and the problems that may arise in actual operation, and popularize the technical information to the public as comprehensively and clearly as possible.
- For operational technical documents, in addition to language review, it is recommended to continue the "document usability test" - a tester with no technical background refers to the document to conduct a complete operation, if the operation is successful, the document usability test passes ; If it fails, you need to continue to revise and improve the document.
- For operational technical documentation, not only describe the steps accurately, but also put yourself in the shoes of the user and provide further details. For example, for the information that needs to be input, provide detailed requirements such as input format; for error information, provide optional operations to resolve the error; for the convenience of users to troubleshoot errors, provide a detailed error code quick check list, etc.
