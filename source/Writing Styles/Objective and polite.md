## Objective and polite

An objective and polite tone should be maintained in technical documents, which is the easiest way to narrow the distance with readers. The specific requirements are:

- Convey technical information objectively, rather than promoting products, otherwise it will easily offend readers.
- Maintain a friendly and polite tone without being tough or rude. For instructional documents, maintain a calm, objective, and concise tone.
- The use of anthropomorphic writing techniques, such as assigning human characteristics, emotions or movements to inanimate objects, should be avoided.
- Do not intersperse with too many jokes in the document, it is advisable to be funny once in a while, so that the personality of the author and the company can be properly displayed and impressive. But it must be remembered that the primary purpose of technical documentation is to convey technical information to readers, not to confuse readers in pursuit of a relaxed and pleasant documentation style.
- Don't use rhetorical questions, which can easily make readers feel questioned and challenged.
- Don't use exclamations lightly. The exclamation may make the reader feel blamed, and it is recommended to be used only in particularly emphasized scenarios. For example, after the reader performs an operation, the data may be permanently deleted, and a strong warning needs to be provided.
- Don't use "please" and "sorry" lightly unless it really bothers the reader.
- Avoid overly affectionate addresses such as "dear", it is recommended to always use "you".
