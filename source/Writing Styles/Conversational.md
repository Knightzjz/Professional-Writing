## Conversational

The tone of technical documentation should be approachable and straightforward, and a conversational style such as "You may..." is recommended. The content of technical documentation itself is often boring and difficult to understand, and it is even more boring if it is also in overly formal language.

The conversational tone used in the document is not meant to be like everyday speech. Instead, colloquial language is often verbose and illogical, and should be avoided when writing technical documentation.
