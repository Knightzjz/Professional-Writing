## spelling

Technical documents may contain cross-lingual content, so the spelling mistakes caused by standards-differences across languages must be strictly avoided. Take Chinese and English as an example:

- Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese cannot be mixed.
- Chinese and English typos are prohibited. Typos include typos and misspellings, neither of which can appear.

    - A typo is a spelling of a word that is artificially made up and has no meaning. For example, MySQL is written as MySOL.
    - A different character is a written word that is close to the correct glyph or sound, but has a different meaning. For example, cooperation is written as corporate, and authorization is written as authentication.

### English upper and lower case

- English uppercase and lowercase forms cannot be wrongly written. If it cannot be written as a MySQL database, it should be written as a MySQL database. For details, please refer to the section [Name Usage](https://zh-style-guide.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/Name and Naming/Name Use.html#id2).

- When there is an English word or phrase in a Chinese sentence, no matter if the English word or phrase is at the beginning, middle or end of the Chinese sentence, **common words and phrases must be lowercase**; **proper nouns, etc. must be in English Capitalized words or phrases, keep their capitalized form**.

    - [Example 1] change 和 transform 意义不同。 Change and transform have different meanings.
    - [Example 2] 这个数据库有不错的 MySQL 兼容性。 This database has good MySQL compatibility.

- When a complete English sentence is included in a Chinese sentence, no matter if the English sentence is located at the beginning, middle or end of the Chinese sentence, **the first letter of the sentence is kept in uppercase**.

    - [Example 1] Follow your fear 是我的座右铭。 Follow your fear is my motto.
    - [Example 2] 他经常与人说“Never set a limit to yourself.”。 He often says "Never set a limit to yourself." to people.
