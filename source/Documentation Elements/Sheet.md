The following guidelines are recommended for the use of tables in technical documentation.

1. Style Specifications

    - All content in cells is **recommended to be left-aligned**.
    - All tables need to have header descriptions, which are phrases in the first row of the table that describe the contents of each column.
    - Ensure that cells in the same row of the table do not spread across pages.
    - A blank line is required under each table, and the style of this blank line is the text. In case of page break, the blank row after the table is the first row of the new page, then this blank row must be deleted.

2. Header specification

    The header descriptions of the same types of tables in the same technical document or product manual need to be consistent.

    [Note] The table that describes the parameters should have a unified header description, and do not have different descriptions such as "parameter description", "parameter explanation", "parameter meaning" and "parameter meaning".

3. Cell Content Specification

    - The content in the table should be as concise as possible, and the text expression style should be consistent. To avoid long descriptions, it is recommended that the content in a cell occupy no more than 6 lines.
    - No blank cells appear. It is recommended to fill in "None" or a symbol with a specific meaning (such as "/") for cells with no content. If symbols with specific meanings are used, the meaning represented by the symbols shall be explained.
    - Avoid repetition of cell content. If the content in multiple cells is the same, it is recommended to copy the content or combine multiple cells instead of using "same as above".

4. Table Description Specifications

    A table description is a line of table description before or after the table, which may be numbered or numbered, mainly to briefly describe the content of the table.

    - Table descriptions are in the form of noun phrases.
    - The table description is concise and to the point, and the length cannot exceed the width of the table.
    - The table descriptions of similar tables are maintained in a consistent style throughout the text.
