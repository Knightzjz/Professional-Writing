## Unit symbol

    The following guidelines are recommended for the use of unit symbols in technical documentation.

    - In order to avoid unclear designation, **it is recommended to use Chinese character names instead of unit symbols**, such as millimeters instead of mm, hours instead of h, and minutes instead of min.
    - **In most cases, a half-width space is required between the value and the unit symbol**, such as 7 kg, 8 MB, 10 GB. But there are several exceptions:

         - When the unit is in degrees, degrees Celsius or percent sign, there is no space between the value and the unit. Such as: 60°, 37°C, 100%, etc.
         - When the unit is the foot symbol and the inch symbol, there is no space between the value and the unit. For example: 4′5″ means 4 feet 5 inches.
