## Graphics and pictures

The following specifications are recommended for inserting graphics and pictures in technical documents.

- Clear and legible graphic images must be used.
- It is recommended to use Chinese for the text on the graphics and pictures in the Chinese document. If the original picture text is in other languages, you should do the picture localization work first.
- It is recommended to use **free open source and commercial fonts** for text to avoid introducing legal risks. If you are not sure whether the font you are using is commercial, you can check it on the [360 Check Font](http://fonts.safe.360.cn/) website.
- Chinese characters on graphic images in the same document should have the same font (such as "Siyuan Black Body"), and English and numbers should also have the same font (such as "Times New Roman").
- Avoid large paragraphs of text in graphics and pictures. It is recommended to place descriptive language outside the figure and replace it with a number.
- When an abbreviation is included in a graphic image, the abbreviation needs to be explained in the illustration description.
- Figure descriptions and figures should be displayed on the same page as much as possible.
- Descriptive text is recommended for naming images.
- Suggest adding alt text when inserting images to improve document accessibility.
