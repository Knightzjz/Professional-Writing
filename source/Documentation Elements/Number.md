The usage of Chinese numerals and Arabic numerals in technical documents is suggested to follow the following specifications.

### Selection of digital form

#### Other Notes

1. Numbers appearing in the same scene should follow the principle of "same category, same form" to select the form of the number.

    If the two numbers express the same functional category (for example, both numbers express the year, month, day, and time), or the two numbers are at the same level in the context (for example, the number of the title at the same level in the article directory), the same number should be used. digital form. Conversely, if the expression functions of the two numbers are different, or the levels are different, different forms can be used.

    - [Example 1] October 1, 2020 or October 1, 2020 (not written as "October 1, 2020")
    - [Example 2] Chapter 1 Chapter 2... Chapter 12 (not written as "Chapter 1 Chapter 2... Chapter 12")
    - [Example 3] The next-level headings of Chapter 2 can be numbered with Arabic numerals: 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2...

2. The ambiguity caused by two adjacent Arabic numerals should be avoided.

    - [Example 1] Three classes of senior three or three classes of senior three (not written as "high 3 3 classes")
    - [Example 2] Class 2 of Senior 3 or Class 2 of Senior 3 (not written as "Class 2 of Senior 3")

3. Chinese numerals and Arabic numerals may be used simultaneously in legal documents, announcement documents or financial documents.

    - [Example 1] The interest rate on the settlement date of the insurance account in July 2019 is 1.5750/10,000 (0.015750%)
    - [Example 2] 35.5 yuan (35 yuan for 5 yuan, 35 yuan for 5 yuan, or 30,500 yuan and 50 yuan)

### Use of Arabic numerals

    - [Correct example] Import a 256 MB data file every 2 minutes.

- Under the premise of not doing any post-typesetting processing, it is recommended to leave a space on both sides of the half-width numbers.

    - [Error example] A 256MB data file is imported every 2 minutes.
    - [Correct example] Import a 256 MB data file every 2 minutes.

- A numerical value written in Arabic numerals must be on the same line, **cannot break the line**.
#### Multi-digit value

It is recommended to follow the following specifications when writing multi-digit values ​​in technical documents.

- Precise numbers with huge numerical values, it is recommended to use "billion, ten thousand" as the unit. For example, 1,023,132,245 people.
- If the value is more than one thousand digits, it is recommended to add a comma "," as a section break.
    - Multi-digit integers are segmented from right to left, each three-digit segment, such as 2,345,567,456.
    - The fractional part is not divided into sections, such as 19,256,289.23456.
    - Integers up to four digits can be undivided, such as 1289.

#### Value range

It is recommended to follow the following specifications for the numerical range written in the technical documentation.

- When indicating the range of values, the wavy connection number "~" or the one-line connection number "—" can be used.

    【Example】-36～-8 ℃, 400—429 pages, 100—198 kg, 12500～20000 yuan

- When the additional symbols or units of measurement of the two values ​​before and after are the same, the additional symbols or units of measurement of the previous value can be omitted if **no ambiguity is caused**.

    [Example] 900 million to 2 billion (can be written as 9 to 2 billion), 130,000 to 1 million (can be written as 13 to 1 million), 64 MB to 1024 MB (can be written as 64 to 1024 MB) , 15% to 30% (can be written as 15 to 30%)

- Use "two" for ordinal numbers, fractions and decimals instead of "two".
- In front of common quantifiers (such as individual, this, piece, hui, species, day), use "two" instead of "two".
- Where "two" and "two" are used, "2" can be used if the measurement and statistical significance are emphasized.
