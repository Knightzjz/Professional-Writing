## abbreviations

For Chinese writters, there are two types of abbreviations in technical documents: Chinese abbreviations and English abbreviations. The concepts, characteristics and usage specifications of the two are introduced as follows.

### Chinese abbreviations

Chinese abbreviations are words shortened and omitted from longer Chinese words, such as "People's Congress", "Restart", "Shutdown", "Bound Nuclear" and so on.

Since Chinese abbreviations are generally few in number and have clear meanings, as long as the abbreviations are easy to understand and do not cause ambiguity in technical documents, there is no limit to the number of times they can be used in principle. If a word must be used a lot in the document, but its acronym is uncommon, it is recommended to explain the situation when the word first appears, reminding the reader that the word will be referred to in the form of abbreviation in the following.

### English abbreviations

There are a huge number and variety of English acronyms. There are three main types of acronyms that appear in Chinese technical documents: acronyms, initialisms, and shortened words. The difference between the three is:

- Acronyms: Consists of the first letter of each word, pronounced as a word.

    - 【Example】NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization

- Alphabetic words: Also made up of the first letter of each word, but pronounced letter by letter.

    - [Example] FBI on behalf of Federal Bureau of Investigation

- Abbreviations: words shortened and omitted from longer Chinese words.

    - [Example] App stands for Application; demo stands for demonstration

The following guidelines are recommended for the use of English acronyms in technical documentation.

- It is not recommended to explain English abbreviations in the title so as not to make the title redundant.
- It is recommended that the full meaning of an abbreviation be explained where it first appears in the text.
- When a word is referred to by an abbreviation, the situation must be explained when the word appears for the first time, and the reader is reminded that the word will be referred to in the form of abbreviation in the following.
- Prohibit the use of irregular abbreviations, for example, "16c32g" for "16 cores, 32 GB"; "10w" for 100,000.
