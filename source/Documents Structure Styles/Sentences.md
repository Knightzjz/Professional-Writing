## sentence

A sentence ends with a period, which indicates that the meaning of the sentence has been completed. Sentence writing requirements are as follows:

- Sentences should avoid long sentences. A sentence of no more than 100 words is recommended.
- Use simple sentences and complex sentences in sentences and avoid using compound sentences.
- Be good at punctuating sentences and avoid the phenomenon of "one joke to the end".

[Error example] The reason is that the DM needs to save the synchronized binlog position information, but the MySQL binlog position official definition uses uint32 storage, so the offset value of the binlog position that exceeds 4G will overflow, and an incorrect binlog position will be stored. After restarting the task or dm-worker, you need to use the binlog position to parse the binlog/relay log again, and the above error occurs.

【Analysis】The above sentence is a compound sentence composed of multiple clauses. The situation of "one joke to the end" increases the difficulty of understanding the meaning of the whole sentence group. In this case, sentences should be segmented in appropriate places, and pronouns such as "this" and "its" should be added to reasonably segment the logic between sentences.

[Modification suggestion] Since the DM needs to save the synchronized binlog position information, and the MySQL binlog position official definition uses uint32 storage, the offset value of the binlog position exceeding 4G will overflow. This will result in an incorrect binlog position being stored. After restarting the task or dm-worker, you need to use the binlog position to reparse the binlog/relay log, and the above error occurs.
