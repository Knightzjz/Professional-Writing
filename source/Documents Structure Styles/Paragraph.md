## paragraph

A paragraph is one of the basic building blocks of a body part and consists of multiple sentences. Paragraph writing requirements are as follows:

- A paragraph can only have one topic, or one central sentence.
- The central sentence of the paragraph is recommended to be placed at the beginning of the paragraph to give an overview of the entire paragraph. The sentences stated later serve the core sentence.
- The length of a paragraph is recommended to be between 50 and 200 words, try not to exceed 250 words. (Word count in Word)
- Avoid having only one sentence in a paragraph. If the sentence is very long, avoid the situation of "**a tease to the end**" and break the sentence reasonably.
- It is recommended to set appropriate spacing between paragraphs to improve readability.
- The sentence tone of the paragraph should be declarative and affirmative, avoiding the use of exclamations.
- It is not recommended to indent at the beginning of paragraphs of technical documents, just start at the top.
- For technical description topics, consider the principle of diagrams first, sentences second, and do not use paragraphs alone to state the topic.
